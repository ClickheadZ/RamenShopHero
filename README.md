# RamenShopHero

This is a prototype for a game originally started for the Bored Pixels Game Jam 5 around Mid-July 2019. 

Ramen Shop Hero is an experimental psychological and spiritual visual novel with exaggerated anime references and experimental gameplay elements.

The game takes inspiration after titles like Yakitate Japan!, Aggretsuko, and many more weird animes.

The story is mainly about 9 characters who have emotional problems in their lives and who come to the ramen shop to eat
away during their periods of affliction. The player is the Ramen Shop Hero, whose miraculous ramen cooking skills
help the characters grow into better versions of themselves. There are obvious nods to Christian beliefs parsed in the Cyberpunky 
Japanese landscape of Sono, a fictional town where the game takes place. 

This project is a work in progress created by peelingSun and ClickHeadZ. The game aims to be launched on Itch.io and Steam in the future.
