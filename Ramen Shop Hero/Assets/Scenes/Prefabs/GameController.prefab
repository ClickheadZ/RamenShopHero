  IntroDialogueParagraphs:
  - His hair is the same colour as the floor he steps on. He slouches ever so slightly
    in his gait.
  - He carries a suitcase and wears a flat blue suit with a uniform red tie, his
    square shoulders hunched forward as if he was about to fall over from carrying
    the weariness of the world.
  - Wearing sunglasses, you can't see where he is looking at, but he does not seem
    to be in a hurry to place his order.
  - You remember the man as Takashi Honda, a man whom you've met a few years ago
    at this very place. He now sits on the same stool as the one where he first sat
    on when you first met him, and he does not move or respond to your head nod.
  - As you recall it, Takashi used to date a young woman when you met him for the
    first time, and they were so in love with each other that Takashi would stay
    at the Ramen Shop for hours after he was done eating, just to talk about her
    with you.
  - You smile at now nearly faded memories, and you continue swiping the counter,
    minding your own business while staying alert to his presence.
  - You think to yourself how odd it is for two people who have shared such strong
    emotions of their love for another person to be then mutually so withdrawn in
    that ensuing passage of time, as if two souls drifting like fleet wood on a sea
    of twinkling fireflies.
  - "The words \u201Clonely men caught staring at the great blaze\u201D echo in your
    mind."
  - Suddenly, as if he supernaturally took notice of his own presence in your deep
    thoughts, Takatsu waves at you with a frangible smile.
  - '"Ramen-san, hi there."'
  - You nod curtly to your old friend.
  - He leans over the counter, the sleeves of his suit tightening around his forearms
    like a bracelet of snakes choking out the life of a little rodent.
  - "\"Been a while\u2026 Sorry for being such a weirdo all of a sudden. I've had
    a rough week, really.\""
  - You look at him with concern and give him your whole attention.
  - '"You know, the girl I was dating? Jenna Greens." '
  - You nod.
  - Takashi can barely speak. You can't hear his voice anymore, and he withdraws
    to himself, seemingly muttering incomprehensible words.
  - "\"We... We\u2019re not together anymore. It's over for us. She walked out on
    me for good.\""
  - What could you possibly reply to him? Words fail you, but you are the Ramen Shop
    Hero, a man who knows the value of silence during these tough moments of life.
    All you need is to be there, and to serve good ramen.
  - 'You hear, in your spirit, your own words: "I will cook you a ramen so good that
    you will never feel like crying again. No, you will cry tears of joy instead.
    The memories of your girlfriend are important, but there are reasons in life
    to rejoice more than our losses, reasons which, as small as a cup of ramen, are
    worth living and fighting for."'
